## INSTRUCTIONS:
Install Tkcalendar and sqlite3 on your systemshell using the following command:<br>
```
pip install tkcalendar
```
```
pip install sqlite3
```
### tkinter: 
Tkinter is the inbuilt python module that is used to create GUI applications. It is one of the most commonly used modules for creating GUI applications in Python as it is simple and easy to work with.
<br> 
### tkcalendar: 
tkcalendar is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter. The DateEntry widget is similar to a Combobox, but the drop-down is not a list but a Calendar to select a date. Events can be displayed in the Calendar with custom colors and a tooltip displays the event list for a given day.
<br>
### sqlite3: 
SQLite is an embedded, server-less relational database management system. It is an in-memory open-source library with zero configuration and does not require any installation. Also, it is very convenient as it's less than 500kb in size, which is significantly lesser than other database management systems.
