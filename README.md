### tkcalendar: 
tkcalendar is a python module that provides the Calendar and DateEntry widgets for Tkinter. The DateEntry widget is similar to a Combobox, but the drop-down is not a list but a Calendar to select a date. Events can be displayed in the Calendar with custom colors and a tooltip displays the event list for a given day.
